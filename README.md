# Linear-Regression
Code to implement Linear regression model using python

The goal of regression is to explore the relationship between the input feature with that of a target value and gives us a continuous valued output for the given unknown data. It's a method to predict the target variable by fitting the best linear relationship between the independent and dependent values. 
Simple Linear Regression model uses a single independent variable to predict a dependent variable by fitting a best linear relationship. 
Least Square Method:  The best fit is done by making sure that the sum of all the distances between the shape and the actual observations at each point is small as possible.  The fit of the shape is "best" in the sense that no other position would produce less error given in the choice of shape.
Y = b0 + b1*x is the equation of the linear regression.
Correlation - Helps to measure the degree of linear relationship between two variables.
Coefficient of Determination or R^2 represents the percentage of variation in output explained by the input variables. 
RMSE Value is the SD of the residuals. It is the measure of how spread out the residuals are.      

Inorder to choose the right regresson model, we mush choose the model with the highest adjusted R^2 value and predicted R^2 value. Variables with low p-values are the most significant ones.
